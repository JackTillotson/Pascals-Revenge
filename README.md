###PLAYING ON MAC:
If you have a mac it should already have ruby installed.
Download the zip of this game and extract it.
Then navigate to the Levels folder and run the file level1.rb by typing:
######Ruby level1.rb
in the terminal.

###PLAYING ON PC:
You will need to download ruby in order to play this game. You can download it here:
#####https://rubyinstaller.org/
I have only tested this on ruby 2.4.0 but it should work on most versions to my knowledge.
Once ruby is installed you can type:
######ruby -v
to see if it was installed. It should return something like: ruby 2.4.0 to let you know the version installed.
Once ruby is installed download the zip of this game and extract it.
Then navigate to the Levels folder and type:
######ruby level1.rb 
in the command line to run the game.
