# Pascals-Revenge
Ruby command line game
## Welcome to Pascal's Revenge!
This is a text based dungeon crawler game designed to be played in one run.
(Saving may be added in the future if the game becomes larger.)

You pick a class to start with, your armor, and weapons.
Then you make your way through the Crypt of the Lich Balanar!
Hopefully surviving and finding his treasure.
If you die, which you will, simply run the game as before and try again!

### PLAYING ON MAC/LINUX?:
If you have a mac it should already have ruby installed.
Download the zip of this game and extract it.
Then navigate to the Levels folder and run the file level1.rb by typing:
###### Ruby level1.rb
in the terminal.

To navigate your file folder in the command line here are some helpful commands:

###### ls
###### cd
ls  displays the files in your current directory.
cd folder_name navigates to the directory either one up
or one down from your current directory.

### PLAYING ON PC?:
You will need to download ruby in order to play this game. You can download it here:
##### https://rubyinstaller.org/
I have tested this on ruby 2.4.0 and 2.4.2 but it should work on most versions to my knowledge.
This installation will open a command prompt and you will simply hit your enter key. It will take a couple minutes to download
and might prompt you again for another download, keep saying yes until it is done.
Once ruby is installed you can type:
###### ruby -v
to see if it was installed. It should return something like: ruby 2.4.0 to let you know the version installed.
Once ruby is installed download the zip of this game and extract it.
Then navigate to the Levels folder and type:
###### ruby level1.rb 
in the command line to run the game.

Here are some useful commands for navigating command line in pc.
###### dir
###### cd
dir displays the files in your current directory
cd file_name followed by a file name takes you to that directory.

### WANTING TO UPDATE PASCAL'S REVENGE?
One way to do this is to simply delete the current game files and download the latest zip file from github.

A less messy way is go to the root of the project(Pascals-Revenge), wherever you put it.
Once you are there type:
###### git pull
This should be enough to have updated changes.
I like to use the free program, Sourcetree, for my github work which is also another option.

If this README is insufficient for getting the game setup, Google your problems!
